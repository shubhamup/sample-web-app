**CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

This project uses GitHub Actions to:

Run tests and linter on every push to main

Build a Docker image

Push it to DockerHub

(Optional) Deploy to a production environment with manual approval


**Secrets Required**

Set the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

DOCKERHUB_USERNAME â€“ Your DockerHub username

**Rollback Strategy**

Before each deployment, the previous Docker image is tagged as previous. In case of a failure, the deployment workflow can roll back to the last stable version.
